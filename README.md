## ✨ Changes
  -- Fixed it to work on Solocraft server.

## ✨ How to use
-- Click on the "B" icon at the right side of the mailbox (only visible when we are in the Send tab).

-- Add a Destination.

-- Click "Include" inside that Destination and then for example click "Items from Bags" to add any item we have in the bags.

-- Finally click the Send button on the mailbox.
  
## ✨ Bugs
  -- When auto-send is interrupted because a destination character’s mailbox is full, the queue will contain incorrect destinations. Close and reopen the mailbox to fix it.
